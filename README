Notes
=====

Adds a simple API and GUI for packaging and configuring Trac themes.

Configuration
=============

trac.ini
--------

All configuration options go in the ``[theme]`` section.

``theme`` : *optional, default: "default"*
    Theme name to use. Name is case-insensitive.

``enable_css`` : *optional, default: false*
    Enable or disable the CSS customizations.

``color.*`` : *optional*
    Stored values for simple CSS overrides. Note that changing this will
    not take effect until you save them in the admin panel.

Web interface
-------------

Theme
~~~~~

Use the arrows to select your theme from the installed options and then click
the button to activate it.

Customize
~~~~~~~~~

Here you can further customize your theme by changing colors for certain
pieces of the UI. The scheme drop down allows you to load pre-configured 
color schemes. Note that not all themes will support this, or support the
same options.

Customize: Advanced
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here you can customize the CSS even further. As mentioned in the file, if you
edit this file by hand, you should not use the simple customizer system or
you will lose your changes.
